# Character Abilities
Character Abilities are an optional part of the game. Players create abilities with the Game Masters to ensure balance. Open communication is key to creating unique character abilities that make your character stand out and feel a part of the Game Masterâ€™s world.

An ability is an action, effect or passive bonus that can be used by a character in order to gain an advantage or to cause a certain outcome. Abilities can be used in combat, social, or even stealth situations. An ability should fulfill as many of the below properties as possible.
