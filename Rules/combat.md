# Combat Rules

## Zone of Control
A character's Zone of Control is the area within 5 feet of a character. This area represents the area that a character can affect with their actions. For example, a character may be able to make melee attacks against enemies within their Zone of Control, but not against those outside of it. A character's Zone of Control may be affected by the size of their weapon, special abilities, and other factors. An enemy invokes an attack of opportunity from a character when they move out of a character's Zone of Control without using a disengage action. This gives the character a chance to make an attack before the enemy can move away. The character must make an attack roll to hit the enemy, and if successful, the enemy takes damage.

## Dodge Tokens
Characters have Dodge Tokens they can use to make an attack made against them more difficult for their enemies to land. Each Dodge Token spent will increase the difficulty of the attack by 1 by default. Characters have a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 10 Dodge Tokens by default. Characters can spend only a single Dodge Token a turn by default. Finally Dodge Tokens use a reaction by default.

There are few ways to refresh Dodge Tokens such as “resting” as determined by the game master, as well as in combat with a dodge action.
