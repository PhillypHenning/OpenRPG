# Tags
Tags represent metadata that can be applied to any person, object, or environment. These are arbitrary and are intended to be used by the DM to alter the normal functions of what it is applied to. Tags provide a simple yet effective way to add extra detail to any scene, person, or item, thus enhancing the storytelling experience.

## Tags in action
Here is an example of how a DM can use tags in their game.

### Environmental
The DM may describe a scene with heavy rain, and in response, create a tag to visually represent this. The heavy rain tag applied to the environment creates the slippery tag for objects and the drenched tag for creatures.

### Object
The slippery tag is added to an object due to the rain. The DM determines that this tag means melee weapon attacks are +1 difficulty and that rolling a 1 on an attack results in dropping the weapon.

### Person
The drenched tag is added to a person due to the rain. The DM determines that this tag means all movement actions are reduced by 5 feet and failing an agility check causes the person to fall prone.
