# Dice Rules

## World interaction - General and Trained Skill Checks

Dice are used to determine how well, if at all, a character performs a given action. The size of the die is determined by the difficulty of the action, as determined by the game master. Once difficulty and a skill are selected, the character can review his character sheet and tags to determine whether any additional modifications can be included in their roll. The character needs to hit the maximum number on their die to be successful. 

| Very Easy | Easy | Medium | Hard | Very Hard | Nearly impossible |

| d4 | d6 | d8 | d10 | d12 | d20 |


## Combat Interaction - Combat Skills
Combat interactions invert the world interaction dice roll. The size of the die is determined by the proficiency of the characterâ€™s weapon skill, the higher the corresponding weapon skill, the smaller the die rolled. Modifiers are applied from character traits and relevant tags if any are applied.

## Skill Duels
### Passive Skill Duel
A passive skill duel describes the interaction between a passive character's skill and an active character's attempt to subvert that skill.  DMs use a world interaction roll based on the passive characters skill being subverted to determine difficulty.


### Active Skill Duel
An active duel represents a contest between two characters in which both characters attempt to outdo the other using a character's skill. Difficulty of the action is based on the opposing characters skill. Players use a world interaction to determine their results. The player who has scored higher wins the active skill duel, if it is a tie, then the DM should either have both succeed or neither as the evenly matched pair are unable to outdo the other.
