# Weapons
## Weapon stat block

| Number of attacks | Damage |
|:---:|:---:|
| The number of die rolled for the action | The damage that is done per success |

## Weapon Attack Formula
`(# of attacks)d(difficulty)+(modifiers) = Total weapon damage`

### Example of a weapon attack
Player 1 has attacked with a short sword. The Short sword in this case has 2 attacks, does 1 damage, has a difficulty of a d8 and a modifier of +1.

The attack action would then result in player1 performing the following attack action:
``` 
d8+1
d8+1
```
For each die that rolls above 8, 1 damage is done to the target. If both hit, total weapon damage would be 2, if 1 hits 1, and if none hit 0.


## Dual Wielding
Dual-wielding allows a player to use two weapons akimbo style to gain certain benefits and drawbacks. Both weapons are used in attacks, resulting in the dice being doubled. Additionally, all attacks become more difficult with a dice difficulty increasing by two.

### Dual Wielding Formula
```
(weapon attacks) * 2
Difficulty +2
```

## Range
Ranged weapons have an ideal range, which is the optimal distance for the weapon to be used. If a character attacks a target within the ideal range, they use the standard stat block. However, if the character attacks a target outside of the ideal range, the total damage of the attack is halved to a minimum of 0. This reflects the fact that weapons are less effective when used at longer distances.

## Special Properties
A property attribute is a descriptive modifier that can be applied to an item. These provide a greater level of detail about an item and can be used to give it special properties or effects. Property attributes can range from physical attributes such as "sharp" or "durable" to magical properties such as "vorpal" or "energy." Property attributes are applied by the Game Master and can be modified to suit individual needs.
