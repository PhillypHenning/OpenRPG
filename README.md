# OpenRPG
OpenRPG is an open source Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG) project. It is a fully featured set of rules with a flexible framework designed to be a base for other game creators to build upon. It is inspired by popular games such as Dungeons and Dragons, City of Mist and Zombicide. 

OpenRPG is a fantastic way to explore the world of Tabletop Roleplaying Games. It provides a solid base of rules and mechanics to build upon, allowing players to create a truly unique experience for their table. With its flexible framework and open source nature, OpenRPG is the perfect way to start your own game!


# Inspirations
OpenRPG focuses on combat and interaction within the game. Combat is modeled after the Dungeons and Dragons combat mechanics with a few modifications to make it more accessible and varied. The tagging system from City of Mist inspired the OpenRPG tagging system which allows players to customize their characters, objects and scenes on the fly. Finally cooperative board game enjoyers will recognize a similar item stat block as those found in Zombicide.
